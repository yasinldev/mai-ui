# Mai UI

Mai UI is a minimalist UI library for modern web apps. 
It offers customizable theming, pre-designed components, and an easy-to-use structure.

## Features
* **Customizable theming** - Mai UI is built with [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), so you can easily customize the look and feel of your app.
* **Pre-designed components** - Mai UI comes with a set of pre-designed components, such as buttons, cards, and more.
* **Easy-to-use structure** -  Mai UI follows a simple and intuitive structure that makes it easy to build and maintain your UI.

## Getting Started
To get started with Mai UI, simply download or clone the repository and include the necessary files in your project. 
Mai UI is built using Sass, so you'll need to compile the Sass files into CSS.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mai-ui.git
cd mai-ui
```

## Customizing the theme
To customize the theme, simply edit the $primary-color and other variables in the 'Typography.scss' file. You can also add your own variables and import them into your Sass files.

## Using the components
Mai UI provides a set of pre-built components that you can use in your project. To use a component, simply include the corresponding HTML and CSS in your project. For example, to use a button, you can include the following HTML:
```html
<button class="btn color-primary">Button</button>
```
And include the CSS:
```css
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mai-ui.css">
```

## Compatibility
Mai UI is compatible with modern web browsers and has been tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Mai UI is not yet compatible with React and Vue.js, but we're working on it.
